    "In this part, I go to summarize all concepts which I have can get of the questions that I put me.\n",
    "To begin with, I will summarize all the questions I asked myself and their corresponding answers.\n",
    "### Are neighborhoods important in get better housing?\n",
    "\n",
    "To obtain this answer I have had to join two dataframes to be able to get the relation of the percentage occupied in front of the neighborhoods where they are located.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "From this, I was able to make a histogram of the percentage of occupation of each neighborhood and to be able to obtain that the neighborhood is related to the occupation of the house, since some neighborhoods had a lower level of occupation.\n",
    "To conclude, I wanted to obtain the reasons why people did not go to those neighborhoods very often and for that I obtained a cloud of words from the houses that were less occupied in the less occupied neighborhood.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "And with that cloud of words I was able to get out that they were reasons that the neighborhood was a bit conflictive since they used words like war, theft, even death.Other reasons were the poor condition of the house with the use of negative descriptions of the place.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this I would avoid using rentals in those places and notify airbnb about these places because it would lower the demand for airbnb use in those areas and could annoy neighborhoods near them.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is the evolution of the different types in Airbnb in Seatle?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this question I wanted to study how the market for airbnb in Seattle is advancing, that is, if it increases over time or remains constant, for this I had taken out the occupation of all the houses we have according to the date and also grouped by the type of room.\n",
    "\n",
    "This last grouping, I made it for the reason of knowing what type of room is the busiest and if it is necessary that airbnb invest more in one type of room instead of another.\n",
    "Make a line graph to have a visualization of the response, and as you could see, the airbnb of Seattle are decreasing dramatically, also the issue of room type does influence the number of rents, because the shared rooms are a failure because it has a very low level of occupation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Elsewhere we see that in general we have a strong decrease, but every x time we have a somewhat recovery, these rebounds will be due to the seasons in which tourists will travel to Seattle for \"vacation\" or other reasons.\n",
    "With this vision, try to avoid having airbnb with a type of shared room because its occupation is very bad and go to rent only houses because they are more likely to rent.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand notify airbnb that they are lowering the occupation of these houses and try to solve it because surely the reason is the poor condition of rented houses and would be giving a bad image to all airbnb rentals and produce a very drastic reduction of this type of business.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How well can we predict an housing of cost? What aspects correlate well to cost?\n",
    "\n",
    "The last question was due to obtain what has more influence on the cost of a rent, for this I created a linear regression model and previously a data cleaning process.\n",
    "\n",
    "I had to select a limited number of columns since most of the columns were categories and if I did the data cleaning with all these values I would have 10 times more columns than records.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the data cleaning process I made an elimination of all the rows that have null values for the predictor variable \"price\" and an imputation of all the numerical variables with the average of their values. And finally, create dummy variables for all category variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then create the predictive model and get the weights of all those characteristics and get the importance that each characteristic has with the price variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important variables were the type of room, because previously we had seen that the type of room influences the occupation of the house, because it also influences the price of the place, in itself it makes sense since a house must be more expensive than a shared room, in addition it also influenced the neighborhood in which the house was located and finally the number of bathrooms and rooms.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is normal that all these variables influence the price since it makes sense that depending on the neighborhood you are in, it is more expensive a house or not, also if a house has more rooms or more bathrooms it is normal that it costs more than one that has a lower number.\n",
    "\n",
    "To finish I have seen that this type of data is quite curious and you can get a lot of valuable information for our problem, which we want to solve, we must also know that these data are located in 2016 possibly by now these problems no longer exist and now people are using a large number of airbnb to travel in a cheaper and affordable to your pocket.\n",
    "I encourage people to study this data and explore more interesting questions they can ask."
